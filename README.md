The purpose of the analysis challenge is to generate a supervised machine learning model that will predict the status of a loan, as healthy loans (class 0) or high-risk loans (class 1). The analysis utilizes a logistic regression as a binary classifier for our model. The analysis conducted was on financial data, focusing on loan size, debt-to-income ratio, borrower income, number of accounts, derogatory marks, interest rate, and total debt.
